2.15
- SectionSetup script: fixes to crossSection material management.
- other minor fixes

2.14
- SectionSetup script: fixes to memory leak and other errors thrown from Unity Job System - (Job System multithreading used here for boundbox calculations on separate thread).
- other minor fixes

2.13
Bounding Box calculation methods have got changed (SectionSetup script):
- the MathGeoLib dll library has got replaced by the dedicated OrientedBounds class.
- The boundbox calculations got based on Unity Job System multithreading.

2.12
General update for Unity 2022.1.0
HDRP:
Adding missing features to "HDRP/Lit" shader.

2.11
A support for UnityEngine.InputSystem was added to scripts and demos.
HDRP:
New CrossSection prebuilt HDRP shader "CrossSectionHDRP/Lit" based on Unity prebuilt "HDRP/Lit" shader (experimental stage).

2.10.1
Shader graphs update. Subgraphs for cross-section keywords got replaced by custom function nodes.

2.10
Single and multiple primitive cutouts were added.

Keyword CLIP_TWO_PLANES got renamed to CLIP_PIE.

Matrix4x4 _WorldToBoxMatrix got renamed to _WorldToObjectMatrix.

Matrix4x4 array _WorldToBoxMatrixes got renamed to _WorldToObjectMatrixes.

BoxSectionExample got renamed to CuboidSectionExample.


The following shaders got renamed:

from "Clipping/Box/SurfaceShader" to "CrossSection/Surface/Box"
from "Clipping/Box/Standard" to "CrossSection/Standard/Box"
from "Clipping/Box/Standard Specular setup" to "CrossSection/Standard (Specular setup)/Box"
from "Clipping/Box/Autodesk Interactive" to "CrossSection/Autodesk Interactive/Box"

Stencil pass added to standard built-in shaders for greater versatility:

CrossSection/Surface (a remake of SurfaceShader)
CrossSection/Standard (a remake of Standard shader)
CrossSection/Standard (Specular setup) (a remake of Standard Specular setup shader)
CrossSection/Autodesk Interactive (a remake of Autodesk Interactive shader)

so the above shaders now substitute the shaders listed below:

Clipping/Corner/SurfaceShader
Clipping/Corner/Standard
Clipping/Corner/Standard Specular setup
Clipping/Corner/Autodesk Interactive

which got removed 

2.9
Update for Unity 2021.2.0, URP 12.0 and HDRP 12.0
HDRP:
Depreciating the usage of CrossSectionHDRP/StencilShowShader (based on HDRP/Unlit shader) in multiple materials with different stencil settings applied to CrossSection caps in capped setups.
Since now using DrawRenderersCustomPass with material based on CrossSectionHDRP/Renderers/StencilShowPass shader. 

2.82
Fixing the URP/LitAndCapPrepare shader - (not showing up on Android and Standalone builds).
Renaming shader macro and complile constants - change from "PLANE_CLIP..." to "SECTION_CLIP..."

2.81
cross section edge effect fix for URP 

2.8
Update for Unity 2020.2.2, URP 10.2.2 and HDRP 10.2.2

2.7
Adding the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) support.

2.6
Renaming standard pipeline shader filenames for better clarity. General improvements and fixes. Update for Unity 2020.1.0

2.5
Selective post process edge effect added in both standard and lightweight render pipelines. Separate color and visibility settings for object and section surfaces.

2.4
BoundBox calculation improvements. Using multithreading and the MathGeoLib library (in Editor). Added GUI/Text (Font) Shader. Added support for TextMeshPro shaders.

2.3
Update for Unity 2019.3.0 LWRP replaced by URP The outline feature was added to URP.

2.2
Update for Unity 2019.2.16 Added support for LWRP and LWRP shader graph.

2.1
Update for Unity 2017.4.1 2.1.1 Changes in capped setup section box and corner box clipping plane stencil shaders. Mapping of these shaders got moved from object uv to world space. New example scenes: - Box section textured - Capped section textured with clipping plane materials corresponding to gameObject materials (e.g. not hatched as in previous examples, but sharing with model gameObject the same diffuse textures).

1.9
Update for Unity 5.6. More examples added: cube section, tube section. Capped setups, together with examples: box section and corner section - added. Caps can hide clipped backfaces. Retrack backfaces - new shader feature added. ==2.0== Outline effect and support for intersecting geometry added. Bounding box calculations were moved from Start function in playmode to OnValidate function in editor. Update for Unity 2017.3.0

1.8
Update for Unity 5.5.x. Added Standard Surface Shader.

1.7
Most of assets got changed. Shaders changed to multicompiled requiring global and material keywords and variables to manipulate. New clipping features: - added the second clipping plane, tilted at an angle to the first one, which can produce a pie section - added sphere section

1.5
More shaders added, including new Unity Standard PBR shader. You can see all the shaders included in “various_materials” scene. Gizmo for clipping plane rotation added. 1.6. PBR shaders update for Unity 5.3.x

1.4
A little reordering and the HorizontalClippingSection.cs script and demo scene added. New Unity 4.6 GUI added
